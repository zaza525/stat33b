Rejection Sampling
==================

Many scientific simulations depend on being able to randomly sample values that
follow a particular distribution.

For example, the heights of adult women in the United States approximately
follow a normal distribution (a "bell curve") with center (mean) at 65 inches
and spread (standard deviation) 3.5 inches. Here's the code to plot that
distribution:
```{r, dnorm}
curve(dnorm(x, 65, 3.5), 50, 80, xlab = "Height (in)",
  ylab = "Probability Density")
```
Heights where the probability density is higher are more likely in a random
sample of women's heights.

In R, we can randomly sample values from a normal distribution with the
`rnorm()` function. The code to sample 10 values from the noraml distribution
with mean 65 and standard deviation 3.5 is:
```{r, rnorm}
rnorm(10, 65, 3.5)
```
R provides functions to sample from a variety of well-known distributions. The
names of these functions usually begin with `r` for "random". For instance,
`rbinom()` samples from a binomial distribution, and `runif()` samples from a
(continuous) uniform distribution.

What if we want to sample from a distribution that's not well-known?

For example, suppose we want to sample from the distribution on -1 to 1 shown
in the plot produced by this code:
```{r, dslide}
dslide = function(x) {
  ifelse(x > 1, 0,
    ifelse(x > 0, dnorm(x) / dnorm(0), dunif(x, -1, 0))
  )
}

curve(dslide, -2, 2, xlab = "Value", ylab = "Density (unscaled)")
```
The distribution is flat (uniform) between -1 and 0, then smoothly curves down
between 0 and 1. In other words, values closer to 1 are less likely than values
between -1 and 0. We'll call this distribution the "slide" distribution, since
it resembles the silhoutte of a playground slide.

We can sample from distributions that are not well-known by using a statistical
technique called rejection sampling. The idea is to choose a shape that
completely encloses the density curve for the distribution, and then randomly,
uniformly sample points within that shape. If a point falls below the density
curve, then the point is accepted and its x-coordinate is a new sample value.
If a point falls above the density curve, then it is rejected (and discarded).
This produces the correct distribution because relatively more points will be
accepted in places where the density curve is taller.

It's convenient to make the enclosing shape a rectangle, because then we can
sample x and y coordinates for points with the `runif()` function. For
instance, for the slide distribution, we can use a rectangle with opposite
corners (-1, 0) and (1, 1).

The exact steps in rejection sampling are:

1. Sample an x coordinate.
2. Sample a y coordinate.
3. Test whether the y value falls below the target distribution's density
   curve. If it does, then x is a new sample value. If it does not, then x is
   rejected.
4. Repeat steps 1-3 until reaching the desired number of sample values.


Exercise 1
----------

Write a rejection sampler for the slide distribution. You can use the
`dslide()` function provided above to compute the height of the distribution's
density curve at a given x-coordinate.

```{r, exercise1}
# Your code goes here.
# reject is a boolean variable that records whether to reject the sample
x = runif(1, -1, 1)
y = runif(1, 0, 1)
y_actual = dslide(x)
reject = FALSE
if (y > y_actual) {
  reject = TRUE
}



```


Exercise 2
----------

Turn your rejection sampler from Exercise 1 into a function called `rslide()`.
Your function should return the final sampled values, and should have a
parameter `n` that controls the number of values to sample.

```{r, exercise2}
# Your code goes here.
rslide = function(n) {
  v = vector(length = n)
  i = 1
  while(v[n] == 0) {
    x = runif(1, -1, 1)
    y = runif(1, 0, 1)
    y_actual = dslide(x)
    reject = FALSE
    if (y > y_actual) {
      reject = TRUE
    }
    if (reject == FALSE) {
      v[i] = x
      i = i + 1
    }
  }
  return(v)
}

#v = rslide(10)
#v
```


Exercise 3
----------

In R, you can use `plot(density(x))` to plot the estimated density curve for a
given sample `x`. Sample 1 million points from the slide distribution and plot
the estimated density.

How does the shape of your estimated density curve compare to the shape of the
actual density curve for the slide distribution (see above)?

_Note: It's important for scientific results to be reproducible. You can set
the "seed" in R's pseudorandom number generator with `set.seed()` to make sure
anyone that runs your code will get the same result, even though the result is
based on random sampling. You can add a call to `set.seed()` before you call
`rslide()` here to ensure the output in your knitted PDF will be the same every
time._

```{r, exercise3}
# Your code goes here.
set.seed(33)
plot(density(rslide(1000000)))

```

YOUR WRITTEN ANSWER GOES HERE:
The shape of the generated plot is very close to the actual density plot, but it has some little bumps along the curve. 


Exercise 4
----------

Use a sample of 1 million points to estimate the mean and standard deviation of
the slide distribution.

```{r, exercise4}
# Your code goes here.
samples = rslide(1000000)
mean = mean(samples)
std = sd(samples)

```

Exercise 5
----------

Create a new version of your `rslide()` function called `rslide_rejected()`.
Instead of returning the sampled vaues, the `rslide_rejected()` function should
keep track of and return the number of points that were rejected.

What percentage of points is typically rejected for this rejection sampler? Use
an average across multiple runs to get a more accurate estimate. The
`replicate()` function may be helpful for calling `rslide_rejected()` multiple
times.

```{r, exerise5}
# Your code goes here.
rslide = function(n) {
  v = vector(length = n)
  i = 1
  num_rej = 0
  while(v[n] == 0) {
    x = runif(1, -1, 1)
    y = runif(1, 0, 1)
    y_actual = dslide(x)
    reject = FALSE
    if (y > y_actual) {
      reject = TRUE
      num_rej = num_rej + 1
    }
    if (reject == FALSE) {
      v[i] = x
      i = i + 1
    }
  }
  return(num_rej)
}

rej = replicate(1000, rslide(1000))
percentage = mean(rej) / 1000
message(percentage)
```

YOUR WRITTEN ANSWER GOES HERE:

On average, 7.7% of points are rejected.
