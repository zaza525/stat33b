### R Markdown Documents

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for
authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R
Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes
both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the
document. You can choose to knit your document to an HTML, Word, or PDF file.

In order to knit to PDF, if you do not already have LaTex on your computer,
you'll need to install the `tinytex` package in R. You can do this in R with
the command `install.packages("tinytex")`. If you need help with this, come to
office hours.

You can embed an R code chunk in the document like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent
printing of the R code that generated the plot.

### Submission Instructions

Edit this file, knit to PDF, and:

* Submit the Rmd file on bCourses.
* Submit the PDF file on Gradescope.

If you think you'll need help with submission, please ask in office hours
_before_ the assignment is due.

Answer all questions with complete sentences, and put code in code chunks. You
can make as many new code chunks as you like. Please do not delete the exercises
already in this notebook, because it may interfere with our grading tools.

As you work, you may find it helpful to be able to run your code. You can run a
single line of code by pressing Ctrl + Enter. You can run an entire code chunk
by clicking on the green arrow in the upper right corner of the code chunk. 

Knit the document from time to time to make sure that your code runs without
errors from top to bottom in a fresh R environment. 

The code below controls the number of significant digits shown for the return
values in your knitted document.

```{r}
options(digits = 3)
```


### Exercise 1

Create a vector `y` with the values `3 5 9 17 33`. Use sequence generating
functions such as `:` and vectorized math rather than `c()`.

```{r, exercise1}
s = seq(1, 5, 1)
y = 2^s+1
y
```

### Exercise 2

Begin by loading the Best in Show "Dogs" data set (posted on bCourses; see
lecture 2 for details). You'll need to edit the path to match where you
downloaded the file on your computer.

```{r}
dogs = readRDS("/Users/andre/Desktop/33b/dogs_full.rds")
dogs
```

R provides a special value `NA`, called the missing value, as a placeholder for
values that are unknown. The missing value can take the place of any of R's
built-in types (integer, numeric, character, and so on).

Missing values are contagious: applying a binary operation to a missing value
usually produces another missing value. For instance:
```{r}
5 + NA
```
Since we don't know the missing value, we can't possibly know its sum with
another number, so the result is again a missing value. An upcoming lecture
will provide more details about and examples of missing values.

You can use the `is.na` function to test whether a value is the missing value.
Compute the number of missing values in the `longevity` column and assign it to
the variable `num_na`.
```{r, exercise2}
num_na = is.na(dogs$longevity)
num_na = sum(num_na)
num_na
```

*Check your answer*: There are about 30 to 40 missing values in the column.


### Exercise 3

The values in the `weight` column are measured in pounds. Convert the entire
column into kilograms (at Earth gravity) and assign the new measurements to
`weight_kg`.

```{r, exercise3}
weight_kg = dogs$weight * 0.453592
weight_kg
```

*Check your answer*: If you did this right, the first few values should roughly
be: `NA 6.12 15.88 6.35 NA 13.61`


### Exercise 4

The values in the `height` column are measured in inches. Create a logical
vector called `smaller_dogs` that has `TRUE` for dogs that are shorter than the
median height (ignoring missing values) of the dogs.

Hint: read the documentation for the `median()` to find out how to ignore
missing values.

```{r, exercise4}
m = median(dogs$height, na.rm = TRUE)
smaller_dogs = dogs$height < m
smaller_dogs
```

*Check your answer*: The first few values in the vector should be `FALSE NA
FALSE TRUE TRUE TRUE`.


### Exercise 5

The 5% trimmed mean is obtained by taking the mean of the middle 90% of the
values (trimming off 10% of the values). Read the documentation for `mean()`
and use this function to find the 5% trimmed mean of the `longevity` column.
Assign the return value from the call to `mean()` to `longevity_mean5`
```{r, exercise5}
mean(dogs$longevity, 0.05, TRUE)
```


### Exercise 6

Create a vector called `weight_rnorm` that is the sum of the `weight` column
and random values from a normal distribution with mean 0 and sd 2.

```{r, exercise6}
# Do not change the set.seed() line!
set.seed(37)
weis = dogs$weight
rans = rnorm(length(weis), 0, 2)
weight_rnorm = weis + rans
weight_rnorm
# Your code here
```

*Check your answer:* The first few values of `weight_rnorm` should
approximately be `NA 14.26 36.16 13.41 NA 29.33`.


### Exercise 7

In this exercise, you'll investigate coercion. Run the following code and
inspect the results, then write an explanation as to why each of the returned
types makes sense.

```{r, exercise7, eval = FALSE}
3L + 3i
smaller_dogs * dogs$height
c(smaller_dogs, dogs$breed)
```

WRITE YOUR EXPLANATION BELOW:
3L + 3i is complex because the sum of an integer and a complex number is a complex number
smaller_dogs * dogs height is double because smaller_dogs is of type "logical" where TRUE is same as 1 and FALSE is the same as 0, and dogs height is of type "double". Thus, a logical multipled by double is double.
c(smaller_dogs, dogs$breed) is of type "character" because when two different types of data are combined, the result is a "character" type. 



### Exercise 8

For this exercise, you'll use the R package `lobstr` to inspect R's
copy-on-write semantics. Install the `lobstr` package with the code:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("lobstr")
```

For the rest of this exercise, you'll need to work in a regular R console
rather than in RStudio (you should have both on your computer if you followed
the setup instructions posted to the bCourse). In the R console, load the
`lobstr` package with the code:
```{r}
library(lobstr)
```

The function `obj_addr()` in the `lobstr` package prints out the memory address
of an R object. Here's some code that I ran in the R console earlier:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
x = 1:7
obj_addr(x)
# [1] "0x7ffbeeab0c78" This does not cause a copy in memory
x[4] = 1000
obj_addr(x)
# [1] "0x7ffbef5817d8" This does not cause a copy in memory 
x[5] = 2000
obj_addr(x)
# [1] "0x7ffbef5817d8" This does not cause a copy in memory
y = x
obj_addr(y)
# [1] "0x7ffbef5817d8" This causes a copy in memory
y[3] = NA
obj_addr(y)
# [1] "0x7ffbef581848" This does not cause a copy in memory 
y[1] = 42
obj_addr(y)
# [1] "0x7ffbef581848" This does not cause a copy in memory 
y = 1 + y
obj_addr(y)
# [1] "0x7ffbef5818b8" This does not cause a copy in memory
```

Run this code in your R console. You'll see different addresses, but should see
the same pattern in when the addresses change.

Edit the code above to replace the memory addresses with the ones you found in
your R console. Next to each assignment, add a comment that say whether the
expression will cause a copy to be made in memory or not.

Are there any surprises? Can you figure out why?

EXPLAIN:
When we assign a variable with the value of another variable in R, the new variable will point to the address of the other variable. Then if we change the value and address of the old variable, the new variable will still be pointed to the same address. 


Once you have completed these tasks, check that you have written your name at
the top of this document and that the document can be knitted.

Finally, it's good practice to print the output of `sessionInfo()` so that
others who want to reproduce your results know what packages and version of R
you were using when you first did your analysis. 

```{r, sessionInfo}
# leave this as-is:
sessionInfo()
```
