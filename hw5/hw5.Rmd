This assignment is due __April 14, 2020__ by 11:59pm.

The purpose of this assignment is to practice using closures and displaying
error messages.

Edit this file, knit to PDF, and:

* Submit the Rmd file on bCourses.
* Submit the PDF file on Gradescope.

If you think you'll need help with submission, please ask in office hours
_before_ the assignment is due.

Answer all questions with complete sentences, and put code in code chunks. You
can make as many new code chunks as you like. Please do not delete the
exercises already in this notebook, because it may interfere with our grading
tools.


Exercise 1
----------

The Fibonacci sequence is formed by adding successive pairs of numbers together
to get the next number. The first ten numbers in the sequence are:
```
1  1  2  3  5  8  13  21  34  55
```

Because each number in the Fibonacci sequence is the sum of the previous two
numbers, it is especially easy to compute the sequence using recursion. Here's
a simple recursive function to compute the `n`-th Fibonacci number:
```{r}
slow_fib = function(n) {
  if (n < 3)
    return (1)

  Recall(n - 1) + Recall(n - 2)
}
```
Unfortunately, this function is quite slow for large values of n. The problem
is that the number of recursive computations grows exponentially with `n`.

For instance, consider calling `slow_fib(10)`. This results in two calls, to
`slow_fib(9)` and `slow_fib(8)`. Each of those calls also results in two calls,
for a total of four more calls. Each of those four calls also results in two
calls, and so on. The first three levels of calls are:
```
slow_fib(9) + slow_fib(8)

slow_fib(8) + slow_fib(7) + slow_fib(7) + slow_fib(6)

slow_fib(7) + slow_fib(6) + slow_fib(6) + slow_fib(5) +
    slow_fib(6) + slow_fib(5) + slow_fib(5) + slow_fib(4)
...
```
As you can see, many of the calls are identical, so the function wastes time
recomputing Fibonacci numbers it has already computed.

The Fibonacci numbers can be computed recursively in a more efficient way by
keeping a record of each number that's already been computed. Using the record,
each number in the sequence only has to be computed once.

This strategy of recording values that have been already computed and reusing
them (rather than recomputing them) is called "memoization". Memoization is a
useful technique for improving efficiency in many programming problems.

Implement a memoized Fibonacci function `fib()`. Like `slow_fib()`, your
function should have a parameter `n` and should return the `n`-th Fibonacci
number. However, your function should "remember" numbers that have already been
computed so they do not have to be recomputed.

Test your function by computing `fib(40)`. If your function is working
correctly, it should be able to compute this number in less than 5 seconds, and
the number should be `102334155`.

_Hint 1: To get started, you need to create a factory function that will
provide the environment for the closure. The factory function should not have
any parameters, and should return your recursive Fibonacci function._

_Hint 2: Use a variable called `memo` local to the factory function (not the
Fibonacci function) to store the computed Fibonacci values. The variable can be
a vector or list. Initialize the variable with 1 at positions 1 and 2; these
are the first two Fibonacci numbers._

_Hint 3: Your Fibonacci function will need to test whether the requested
Fibonacci number is already in `memo`, and act accordingly._


```{r}
# Your code goes here.
memo = c(1, 1)

fib = function(n) {
  if (n <= length(memo)) {
    return (memo[n])
  } else {
    while (length(memo) < n){
      i = length(memo)
      memo[i + 1] = memo[i-1] + memo[i]
    }
    return (memo[n])
  }
}

fib(40)

```


Exercise 2
----------

Use the microbenchmark package's `microbenchmark()` function to compare the
speed of `slow_fib()` and `fib()`. Benchmark how long it takes each function to
compute the 20th Fibonacci number.

Memoization is a tradeoff. Although memoization increases the speed of a
computation, can you think of any potential drawbacks? Explain in 1-3
sentences.


```{r}

# Your code goes here.
library(microbenchmark)

n = 20
microbenchmark(slow_fib(n), fib(n))
```

YOUR WRITTEN ANSWER GOES HERE:
I think there are two major drawbacks of memoization:
1. It is hard to implement and therefore reduce the readibilty of code
2. It takes more space (compared with slow_fib) in order to store information


Exercise 3
----------

Make a new version of your `fib()` function that includes error handling. If
the user supplies a non-positive `n`, the function should print the error
message `"n must be positive (got n = N)"` where N is replaced by the value of
`n`.


Test your function for `fib(-1)` and `fib(5)` (to confirm that it still works
for positive values).

_Hint 1: See this week's lecture video for how to generate error messages._

```{r}
# Your code goes here.
memo = c(1, 1)

fib = function(n) {
  if (n < 0) {
    warning("n mush be posituve (got n =", n, ")")
    return ()
    }
  if (n <= length(memo)) {
    return (memo[n])
  } else {
    while (length(memo) < n){
      i = length(memo)
      memo[i + 1] = memo[i-1] + memo[i]
    }
    return (memo[n])
  }
}


```

```{r, error = TRUE}
# Use this cell to test.
#
# The `error = TRUE` setting tells knitr to knit despite any errors in this
# cell.
fib(-1)
fib(40)
```
